How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How do I approach designing software?
This class has taught me so much. I have truly appreciated the process of repeating the same process over and over again and drilling it into my brain. I rteally feel like I have learned a lot and have a good grasp on unit testing. To ensure that my code is functional, I have been running it after every few lines of code. I know that it is secure beacause I have run many unit tests on it. After every single unit test, I run the test and ensuyre that it passes. I also run coverage on my project to make sure that I am covering every test that I need to. 
I incooperate user needs by taking into account what needs to be included in the code such as address, unique ID, etc. I also make sure that they are the correct length required and that they are not entered as null. 
My approach to designing software is slow and steady. I like to take it one step at a time so that I do not get overwhelmed. I usually start by writing my main function and then all the rest of my code. After this I create and run my unit tests.
